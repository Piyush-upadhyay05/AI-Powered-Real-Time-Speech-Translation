# 🌍 AI-Powered Real-Time Speech Translation

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to **break language barriers in live OTT streaming** by enabling **real-time speech-to-speech translation**.  
It converts live commentary in **English or Hindi** into **12+ global languages** using **Azure Speech Services** and **OpenAI-based translation models**.  
The translated speech is seamlessly embedded into OTT feeds, delivering **multilingual commentary with minimal latency**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🎧 **Real-Time Speech Recognition** using Azure Speech-to-Text  
- 🌐 **AI Translation** into 12+ languages (Hindi, French, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, etc.)  
- 🔊 **Speech Synthesis** — Converts translated text into natural-sounding audio  
- ⚡ **Low Latency** — Real-time performance optimized for live streaming events  
- 🧩 **Seamless Integration** with existing OTT platforms  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Azure Cognitive Services** (Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech)  
- **Azure OpenAI**  
- **Deep Translator (Google Translator API)**  
- **Streamlit** – Frontend Web App

## 📅 Project Implementation Milestones

### 🔹 Milestone 1 – Foundation (Weeks 1–2)
- Configured Azure Speech-to-Text infrastructure  
- Collected and preprocessed English/Hindi audio data  
- Developed code to detect and convert speech into text  

### 🔹 Milestone 2 – Intelligence (Weeks 3–4)
- Built translation module using Azure OpenAI & Deep Translator  
- Supported 12+ languages for multilingual output  
- Evaluated translation quality using BLEU scores and latency metrics  

### 🔹 Milestone 3 – Integration (Weeks 5–6)
- Combined recognition and translation into an end-to-end pipeline  
- Integrated with Streamlit for real-time user interaction  

### 🔹 Milestone 4 – Deployment (Weeks 7–8)
- Deployed on cloud for live testing  
- Verified accuracy and performance across devices

## 🧩 How It Works

1. 🎙️ **Speech Capture** – Azure captures live English/Hindi commentary  
2. 💬 **Text Recognition** – Speech is converted to text in real time  
3. 🌐 **AI Translation** – Text is translated into multiple target languages  
4. 🔊 **Speech Synthesis** – Translated text is spoken back using TTS  
5. 📡 **OTT Integration** – Translated audio is streamed to end users
